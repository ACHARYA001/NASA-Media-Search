## API Reference

# APOD
One of the most popular websites at NASA is the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html).
In fact, this website is one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. 
This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the image explanation are returned. 
These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.


The full documentation for this API can be found in the [APOD API Github repository](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).
